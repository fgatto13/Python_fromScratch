# Python_fromScratch, my Learning Journey üêç

Welcome! This repository documents my hands-on journey into Python, approached from the perspective of a computer scientist looking to **adapt to Python‚Äôs ecosystem** for real-world applications.

While many of the concepts covered here are foundational, the motivation behind this project goes well beyond the basics. My main goals include:

- Learning Python as a springboard to **CUDA parallel programming**
- Gaining fluency for **LLM, ML/AI development**
- Learning how to create user-friendly GUIs and full stack applications using one of the most versatile programming languages out there

This repo is structured progressively ‚Äî from language fundamentals to more practical coding exercises ‚Äî and is continuously evolving as I move toward more advanced topics.

Everything covered in this repo is done following the tutorials provided by [BroCode](https://www.youtube.com/@BroCodez)

## Dependencies

Note that most of the code provided uses external modules and libraries, and therefore you need to download them (I use pip install) before starting out.
