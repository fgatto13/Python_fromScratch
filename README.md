# Python_fromScratch, my Learning Journey üêç

Welcome! This repository documents my hands-on journey into Python, approached from the perspective of a computer scientist looking to **adapt to Python‚Äôs ecosystem** for real-world applications.

While many of the concepts covered here are foundational, the motivation behind this project goes well beyond the basics. My main goals include:

- Learning Python as a springboard to **CUDA parallel programming**
- Gaining fluency for **LLM, ML/AI development**
- Using **network simulation** to deepen my understanding of protocol design (e.g., TCP/IP)
- Learning how to create user-friendly GUIs and full stack applications using one of the most versatile programming languages out there

This repo is structured progressively ‚Äî from language fundamentals to more practical coding exercises ‚Äî and is continuously evolving as I move toward more advanced topics.

## üìÇ Project Folders

| Folder | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `PyOOP/`   | Everything related to Object Oriented Programming in Python. |
| `Python_basics/`         | from I/O to the main module, and everything in between to learn how to properly use Python. |

## üî≠ What's Next?

This repo is a foundation for diving deeper into:

- **Parallel computing** with Python (via CUDA and Numba)
- **Machine learning and AI** (leveraging libraries like NumPy, TensorFlow, PyTorch)
- **Network simulations** to model and analyze communication protocols

As this journey continues, expect more folders and more focused projects to appear ‚Äî including `llm_experiments/`, `cuda_python/`, and `network_simulations/`.
