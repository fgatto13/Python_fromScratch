# Inheritance

inheritance is an OOP mechanism
that allows a child class to inherit its super class
characteristics (variables and methods),
while also adding new features.

for instance, a student is a person,
therefore, person is a super class of student.

when the student class inherits the person's class,
it inherits attributes such as name and age,
plus adding new features such as grade average and so on

it helps with *reusability* and *extensibility*
