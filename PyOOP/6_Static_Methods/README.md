# Static Methods
A *static method* is a method that belongs
to a class, rather than any object from that class.

Usually, it is used for general utility functions.

In a class, there are two main types of methods:
1. **Instance Methods**: best for operations on instances of the class (standard methods)
2. **Static Methods**: best for utility functions that do not need access to class data
